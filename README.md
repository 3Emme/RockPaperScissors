## Description

Recreate the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. For anyone who has never played it, here are the rules:

- It is played by 2 people. Each person chooses "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" by forming a shape with their hand.
- They choose at the same time, so that each person doesn't know what the other person has picked.
- If one person chooses "Rock" and the other person picks "Scissors" then "Rock" wins. It's a game of combinations:

```
Rock v. Scissors = Rock wins
Rock v. Paper = Paper wins
Paper v. Scissors = Scissors wins
```

- If both people choose the same thing, then it is a draw and nobody wins.

## Specs

Write a method that can handle the different combinations
Your method should take 2 inputs - one for each player's choice
It should return "Player 1" if the first input wins, "Player 2" if the second input wins, and "Draw" if nobody wins.

### specs for all possible combination of plays:
tie Spec:
if input == input2 = tie 
Scissor is superior paper
Paper is superior to rock 
Rock is superior ti scissor 

Always odd, in the case of 7 total, 3 from the choice is defeated and the following 3 defeat the choice. 

1 = scissor 2= paper  3= rock 4=lamp

{1, 2, 3, 4}

index ++ is always superior in a loop
